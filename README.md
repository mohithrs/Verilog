# Verilog
#Viterbi Decoder Design For SDR  on an FPGA
Code Rate = ½, Constraint Length (K) = 9
Some consequences of using a constraint length of 9 are:
 The amount of branch metric is 2 K = 512 branches.
 The amount of state metric is 2 K-1 = 256 states.
 The depth of trace back process is at least = 5
